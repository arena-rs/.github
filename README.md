***Universal framework to help experienced LPs refine their liquidity management strategies through robust market simulation and analysis.***

A powerful and extensible framework for holistic economic modelling and simulation of Uniswap v4 strategies, hooks and pools. A sandbox that utilises stochastic modelling to simulate pool strategies in different market conditions, and thus allow liquidity providers and sophisticated market participants to derive deep, mathematical insight about their strategy.

Currently Arena is:
* [`arena`](https://github.com/arena-rs/arena): Core simulation toolkit and framework.
* [`octane`](https://github.com/arena-rs/octane): Modified version of Arbiter engine to use Alloy and Anvil.
